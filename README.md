# Light Task Manager

The Task Manager app is the showcased app in the free course: **Building Firebase Powered Ionic Apps** which covers:

* User Authentication.
* CRUD.
* Firebase Cloud Functions.
* Firebase Security Rules.
* ...and more.

## Installation

Clone this repository using ssh:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:javebratt/firebase-ionic-cloud-functions.git
```

Or https:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/javebratt/firebase-ionic-cloud-functions.git
```

Once cloned, move into the app folder and edit the name of the file
`app/credentials.backup.ts` to be simply `app/credentials.ts`.

Inside that file you'll add your Firebase keys which you can get from
